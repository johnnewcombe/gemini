RPM 2.3 is the last RP/M ROM image produced. The archive below includes two ASC files one for use with the serial default set for 300 and the second for 9600 baud.

This version 2.2 of RP/M was (supposedly) never released, the version numbers leapt from V2.1 to V2.3 to avoid confusion with version 2.2 of CP/M, this was confirmed in an article written for 80-bus news by RP/M's creator Richard Beal (80-BUS vol. 3 iss. 6 p. 9). However, the image here was discovered on a Multi-Board machine in 2019 and attempts to boot in a different way to the normal RP/M.

The SIMON_45_MFB_TIMECLAIM.ROM image was taken from a machine owned and used by Timeclaim Ltd. Timeclaim were a company that produced versions of the Galaxy MFB Multi Format Bios machines.
