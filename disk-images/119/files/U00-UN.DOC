UN      .DOC

        The documentation for UN.COM can be  read  by  entering
TYPE  UN.COM  on  your  system.  A  very niffty program by Bill
Norris for UNprotecting Microsoft  Basic programs.

        It is hoped that users of UN will only use it UNprotect
or  recover  their  own  programs  and not 'rip off' commerical
software.
