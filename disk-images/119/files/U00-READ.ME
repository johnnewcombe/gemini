Hi,
	Hope you find this helpful, and I am confident
bug free. Certainly Mass copy and Log will work for 31 user
numbers.
	Nsweep207 was dissassembled by MDIS (M.T.Walters I think)
and assembled using Z80ASM from SLR systems(Grey Matter). M80 
should work. Z80ASM is wonderful, and only #50.00!!!!

	I found nswp208 a few days ago on a BB, but I'm not going
to use this; I will keep to Nswp207.

Good luck and let me know how you get on.

				John.
