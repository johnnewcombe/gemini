                    WHATSNEW.DOC

     WHATSNEW  is  a variation of the  Ward  Christensen  program 
D.COM.  When initialized it captures a copy of the directory, and 
when   called  subsequently  it  reports  the  additions  to  and 
deletions from the disk since the date of initialization.  

     WHATSNEW must be resident in each USER area on each disk  in 
order  to report properly since it keeps an internal copy of  the 
DIR within itself.

     The command sequence to initialize WHATSNEW is:

          WHATSNEW LOK

     then

          WHATSNEW BLD mm/dd/yy

     where:
           mm is the present month
           dd is the present day of the month
           yy is the present year
