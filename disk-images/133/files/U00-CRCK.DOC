        Origin: US CP/M Users' Group, revised Richard Beal.

        This utility displays the CRC type checksums of all the files on
the disk. Will accept ambiguous and unambiguous file names.

Command syntax is as follows:

>CRC

Will search for a CRCKLIST.CRC file on the disk and compare it with  the
files present, reporting any errors found and the absence of any file.

>CRC [d:]*.* [F]

Will generate CRCs for the ambiguous or unambiguous files  specified  on
the  optional  drive [d:] specified. The inclusion of the [F] will cause
the CRCs to be sent to a file called CRCKLIST.CRC on the default  drive.
Note  the square brackets indicate these are optional parameters and the
square brackets themselves should not be entered in the command line.
