          If  the  "F"  or  "V" command is  entered  in  answer  to  the    
     system prompt "*",  the computer will ask the operator to    select 
     which  FLOPPY  number  is to be  formatted/verified.     After  the 
     operator  has selected the required FLOPPY number     the  computer 
     will display the list of available    FORMATS.  He simply types the 
     required  FORMAT number and    presses RETURN.  In order to finally 
     activate the    format/verify command he must press the RETURN  key 
     once     more.  Note  that formatting a disk will destroy  all  the    
     previous  information  stored  on  that  diskette.   If  a  "V"  is    
     entered after the "F" ,  the system will perform a verify on    the 
     diskette after the formatting process.
