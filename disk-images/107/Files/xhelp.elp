                         AEXAMINE A DISKETTEN

               This  command  allows  the operator  to  examine 
          portions  of a diskette.  He can either look at  just 
          simple  tracks  and  sectors  or  move  through   the 
          diskette  to the next allocation block.  This command 
          is  very useful for checking and analysing a  FORMAT. 
          This  command  has  its own sub  menu  which  can  be 
          recovered  by pressing "?" at any time during the use 
          of  the  command.   The  operator  simply  types  the 
          tracks/sectors or allocation groups that he wants  to 
          display  and  the system automatically  displays  the 
          information  on  the screen.  Simply pressing  RETURN 
          increments the system to the next sector. The extreme 
          right  portion  of  the  screen  shows  the   printed 
          equivalent  of  the information in ASCII whereas  the 
          left side of the screen shows the actual  hexadecimal 
          values.
