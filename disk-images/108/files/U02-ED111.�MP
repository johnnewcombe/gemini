NOTES ON IMPLEMENTING THE ED111 TEXT EDITOR ON YOUR SYSTEM.
***********************************************************

	THE ED111 TEXT EDITOR COMPRISES AN ALMOST UNMODIFIED COPY OF
EDITX111 FROM THE INTEL USERS LIBRARY WHICH HAS BEEN LINKED WITH TRANSLATOR
MODULES ALLOWING CP/M TO PROCESS ALL CALLS TO THE INTEL OPERATING SYSTEM
ISIS-II. THE TRANSLATOR MODULES ARE UNIVERSAL IN THAT THEY PROVIDE ALL THE
FACILITIES NORMALLY FROVIDED BY THE MORE POWERFUL ISIS AND BECAUSE OF THIS
THEY COULD BE LINKED WITH ANY PROGRAM ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR ISIS-II
OPERATING SYSTEM, THE PROGRAM WOULD THEN OPERATE UNDER CP/M.
	A COMPLETE SET OF MODULES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BUT ONLY THOSE NEEDED
BY THE EDITOR HAVE BEEN INCLUDED HERE. BY USING THESE MODULES I AM ABLE TO RUN
THE INTEL MACROASSEMBLER AND PL/M PLUS MANY OTHER INTEL PROGRAMS UNDER CP/M.
	NOTE THAT ALL ERROR NUMBERS CORRESPOND WITH THOSE PRODUCED BY ISIS.
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ISIS IS AVAILABLE IN THE ISIS-II USERS GUIDE WHICH
IS AVAILABLE FROM INTEL. IT IS MANUAL NO.9800306D.
	BECAUSE ISIS READS AND WRITES FILES TO AN EXACT LENGTH, IT HAS
BEEN NECESSARY TO USE THE LOWER SEVEN BITS OF BYTE S1 OF THE CP/M FCB
TO RECORD THE BUFFER POINTER POSITION OF THE LAST RECORD OF EVERY FILE.
MY VERSION OF CP/M (WHICH WAS NOT WRITTEN BY DIGITAL RESEARCH) DOES NOT
USE BYTE S1 FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THIS. IF YOUR VERSION USES THIS
BYTE OR MODIFIES ITS VALUE IN ANY WAY THEN THE EDITOR WILL NOT WORK
CORRECTLY. EVIDENCE OF THIS WILL SHOW AS FAILURE OF EDIT.MAC TO LOAD
PROPERLY AND FOR UP TO 127 UNWANTED CHARACTERS TO BE INSERTED AT THE END
OF EVERY FILE. SINCE THE EDITOR BOTH READS AND WRITES FILES TO AN EXACT
LENGTH IT DOES NOT NEED ^Z OR ANY OTHER INDICATION OF END OF FILE,
CONSEQUENTLY NONE IS INSERTED. IF ^Z IS REQUIRED IT MAY BE INSERTED
MANUALLY OR AN EXIT MACRO MAY BE WRITTEN WHICH WILL DO IT AUTOMATICALLY.
	ADDITIONALLY SINCE THE EDITOR WAS WRITTEN FOR ISIS-II OPERATING
SYSTEM IT REQUIRES THE USE OF ISIS FILENAME CONVENTION. THIS IS ALMOST
THE SAME AS CP/M CONVENTION BUT LIMITS FILENAMES TO SIX CHARACTERS PLUS
A THREE CHARACTER EXTENSION. ISIS USES A DIFFERENT CONVENTION FOR
INDICATING DISK DRIVES I.E :F0: & :F1: INSTEAD OF A: & B:, ALSO IT
USES DIFFERENT NAMES FOR DEVICES :CO: & :CI: INSTEAD OF CON:. NOTE THAT
ISIS TREATS ALL DEVICES THE SAME AS FILES. (TRY THE COMMAND
ED111 :CI: TO FILE). ALSO NOTE THAT ISIS ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO DRIVE :F0:.
	SINCE THE NORMAL DIGITAL RESEARCH CCP DOES NOT SUPPORT ISIS
FILENAMES, (AS FAR AS I KNOW ANYWAY), A SPECIAL REPLACEMENT CCP IS PROVIDED
HERE WHICH ALLOWS BOTH CP/M AND ISIS FILENAME CONVENTIONS. IT ALSO HAS
A DIRECTORY FORMAT WHICH SHOWS FILE ATTRIBUTES W FOR WRITE PROTECTED AND
S FOR SYSTEM IF THESE HAVE BEEN SET. SYSTEM FILES ARE NOT DISPLAYED UNLESS
A SWITCH S IS USED IN THE DIR COMMAND. THIS CCP ALSO INDICATES THE NUMBER
OF FILES AND THE AMOUNT OF FREE DISK SPACE. IT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE
STANDARD CCP AND MAY BE INCORPORATED INTO YOUR SYSTEM. A MINOR MODIFICATION
WILL BE REQUIRED FOR SYSTEMS WHICH USE A TWO BYTE ALLOC.
	IF YOU REQUIRE TO ACTIVATE THE PROTECTION AGAINST EXITING WITH YOUR
DISK DRIVE DOOR OPEN, SWITCHED OFF, WRITE PROTECTED ETC. YOU SHOULD INSERT
YOUR OWN DISK STATUS PROCEDURE WHERE INDICATED. A DUMMY PROCEDURE HAS BEEN
INCLUDED FOR NOW AS CP/M DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANY PROVISON TO FIND
DISK STATUS UNTIL AFTER IT IS TOO LATE TO BE OF USE.
	THE MACRO FACILITIES OF THIS EDITOR ARE VERY POWERFUL, THE MACRO
LIBRARY PROVIDED IS THAT PROVIDED BY THE INTEL USERS LIBRARY AND IS ONLY
A SAMPLE OF WHAT MAY BE DONE. TRY WRITING A MACRO TO AUTOMATICALLY INSERT :
AFTER EVERY LABEL (BUT NOWHERE ELSE) IN A FILE. IT CAN BE DONE BUT REQUIRES
MORE THAN THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT.
