The listing for this utility appeared in Dr.Dobbs, October 1980.

" This article describes the design and
use of a utility which makes it practical
to use a single disk drive on the Digital
Research CP/M operating system. The
entire source is included in this article,
and is also available from the author
on an 8" single density, 128-byte sector
diskette, along with a few other public
domain programs, from the above address,
for $15. I hereby release MFT into
the public domain, for use on any CP/M
(or other) system. No right is granted
for resale, with or without modifications.

To use MFT, merely type its name,
followed by one or more ambiguous file
names (using ? and/or * wildcards).
You will be prompted to mount the input
disk and type CR. At this time, the disk
with MFT may be removed, if the desired
files are on a different disk. Once the
input disk is mounted, the directory
will be searched and a list of all file
names which satisfy at least one of the
ambiguous file names will be compiled.
As many files as will fit into memory will
then be read. You will then be asked to
mount the output disk and type CR.
Note that MFT can write on this disk
without your having to 'log it in'. All
data read from the input disk is then
written to the output disk. If more
files remain to be read, this cycle repeats
until all files are transferred. As an
example, MFT *.* may be used to copy 
all files from one disk to another.
