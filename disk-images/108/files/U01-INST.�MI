^THIS PROGRAM IS VERY SLOW AS IT RUNS UNDER ^BASIC - ^BUT IT
HAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF BEING EASY TO PATCH (COMPARED TO A
COM FILE!). ^THIS IS IMPORTANT AS MOST ^PRINTERS HAVE FEATURES
SUCH AS DOUBLE WIDTH PRINT WHICH REQUIRE SPECIAL CONTROL CODES
TO INITIATE. ^WITH ^L^E^T^T^E^R YOU CAN ADD THESE FEATURES AS
YOU WISH.
QQS 1
^TO USE- ^CREATE A FILE USING ^E^D OR OTHER EDITOR. ^FILETYPE
MUST BE .^F^M^I ^THEN ^R^U^N ^L^E^T^T^E^R AND CHOOSE TO
PRINT IT OR FILE A COPY (^CREATES ^FILETYPE ^J^U^S).^IF
YOU WANT MORE THAN ONE COPY IT IS QUICKER TO FILE AND THEN
^R^U^N ^P^R^I^N^T WHICH PRINTS THE FORMATTED FILE.^NOTE THAT IF
YOU DONT USE THE ^B^O^L^D OPTION YOU CAN USE ^R^E^M^O^V^E TO ERASE
QUOTES FROM THE .^J^U^S FILE AND THEN JUST USE ^C^P/^MS ^T^Y^P^E
COMMAND TO OUTPUT.
QQS 1
^PLEASE NOTE THAT ^I HAVE PATCHED MY ^B^I^O^S TO SWITCH MY
PRINTER ^ON & ^OFF ON CONTROL ^P (HENCE THE ^C^H^R$(16)).^I
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS METHOD IF YOU HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE ^I^O
BYTE AT LOCATION 0003.^IF YOU WANT DETAILS OF HOW TO DO THIS
YOU ARE WELCOME TO CONTACT ME.
