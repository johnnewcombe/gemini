ED111
=====

David Back's incredible Macro Text Editor, adapted from X111 in the Intel users
library to run under CP/M. Lots of improvements and a careful and detailed
documentation. Also a replacement CCP for CP/M2.2 with various improvements.
Part of ICOS-80 David's very own rendition of CP/M to run under ISIS.
