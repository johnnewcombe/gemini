               This   command  will  interrogate   an   unknown 
          diskette.  If  the I command is entered,  the  system 
          will  prompt the operator to enter the FLOPPY  number 
          in  which  the diskette is to  be  interrogated.  The 
          operator must select a 96TPI FLOPPY. If the I command 
          is  followed  by an "L" the program's output  to  the 
          screen  will  also go to the printer (if  connected).
