                    ANEW, DISPLAY AND EDIT FORMAT DATAN

     These  commands allow the operator to add,  ammend and change  the FORMAT 
data within the system.  He simply types "D" or "E" followed by the number  of 
the FORMAT that he wishes to view or change. If he does not know the number of 
the   FORMAT   that  he is going to edit or view he simply types  "D"  or  "E" 
RETURN.  The   system   will then prompt him with a list of  the  FORMATS   in 
alphabetical   order.   He   then only has to type the number of   the  FORMAT 
followed  by  RETURN.  To enter a new format the operator need only  type  "N" 
RETURN and the system will select the next available FORMAT number. 
     During  entering  or  editing  the operator may leave  a  field  of  data 
unchanged by simply typing RETURN. If he wishes to exit from  editing the data 
without  saving the changes he simply  types ESC.  The operator can enter  any 
number of names for one particular FORMAT.   To  do this he should type CURSOR 
UP in the  format  name field.  If the operator is only making a small  number 
of  changes  to  a  FORMAT he may wish to press the CURSOR DOWN  key  and  the 
system  will   pass  through  all  the remaining data   without   making   any 
further changes.
