To extract the programs contained in libraries on this disk,  use 
NULU. The procedure is:

     NULU                        {start the NULU program}
     -o  <library file name>     {Open the library file}
     -q *.*                      {Extract and usqueeze all entries}

{note:  if  there is not room on the current disk drive  for  the 
extracted files, use -q <new drive name>:*.*, for example:
     
     -q b:*.*

to have all the extracted files put on the disk in drive B: }

There  are  many other options available with this fine  program, 
but the sequence above is all you really need to know.

To unsqueeze files not in libraries (files with a Q in the middle 
of the extension e.g. FILE.DQC), use NSWP. Tag the files with the 
'T' command and use the 'Q' command to unsqueeze the files.
