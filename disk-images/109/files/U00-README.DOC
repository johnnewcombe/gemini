
This disk  has a 58k CPM on.  It is the latest Lucas BIOS Ver 3.2 
but it also includes CCPZ, BDOSZ and MDISK. This last item is the 
software  that  will use the extra 192k of RAM on the MAP80  256k 
RAM Card as a memory Disk.   CCPZ, BDOSZ and MDISK have also been 
patched into MOVCPM. To avoid confusion with your standard MOVCPM 
it  has been renamed.   There is one version called  MOVGEM,  use 
this  for  most purposes creating a 58k system but as  there  are 
some  conflicts between XBASIC and BDOSZ there is  another  named 
MOVGEN use it to create a 55k system if you are using XBASIC.  On 
the  disk  is a program called AVCMOD.COM.   This is  a  modified 
version  of Ver 2.7 of AVCTXTS.   The CPM has been setup to  call 
this automatically and AVCMOD then calls a program called SD wich 
stands  for  Super  Directory".   This displays the files on  the 
current user area in alphabetical order with file sizes. There is 
also a copy of AVCTXT to use instead with the 55k system.


There  are  some  CPM  utilities  on the 58k  disk:

FORMAT  and CONFIG
          These  must be used with the new CPM.   Rename them  or 
          erase all your old versions for safety. 

BCOM      This is a Binary Compare program.   It will compare the 
          bytes of two programs and display the differences.   It 
          is useful if you think a file has not copied correctly, 
          or  to find where serial numbers are stored if you have 
          two copies of a program.  The format is:- 
               BCOM d:fileone.ext d:filetwo.ext

ERASE     This is used to erase a list of files. The format is:
               ERASE d:fileone.ext filetwo.ext..............

FINDBAD   This  will find any bad sectors on a disk and put  them 
          all into one file called UNUSED.BAD.   It allows you to 
          continue using a disk with physical damage on it.

LIST      This is like the CPM "TYPE" except the output is  paged
          to the printer. 

LISTMEM   This  will  list  the first 80 bytes from  a  specified 
          memory location.  The format is:-
                LISTMEM xxxx 
          where xxxx is an address from 0000 to FFFF.

MFT       This stands for Multi File Transfer.  It will ONLY copy 
          from  the  logged on drive.   The  default  destination 
          drive is the other drive in a two drive system.  If you 
          have  three  drives or a memory drive then you need  to 
          specify the destination drive if it is not the default.
          The format is:-

               MFT d:fileone.ext filetwo.ext filethree.ext.......
ŠNSWP      This stands for New Sweep.   There used to be a program 
          called Sweep.   NSWP is shorter and faster.  You use it 
          to  tag files for copying or erasing.   It is  able  to 
          copy between different User numbers.  PIP can only copy 
          from not to a different User area.

PIP       This  is not the standard PIP.   You are able to log  a 
          new  disk if you change them by pressing "R".  Also  by 
          pressing "Q" you can repeat the last PIP command.

SERIAL    This just displays the CPM serial number in decimal.

SPZ       This  is  a Disk Doctor configured for a  Nascom.  (See 
          also DU on the UTILITIES disk).  They both allow you to 
          read  any sector on the disk,  modify it and  write  it 
          back.   They  are  both  very  useful but  as  well  as 
          repairing a disk you can also destroy it if you do  not 
          know what you are doing.  DU is very useful if you have 
          lost  or damaged the directory or part of a file.   You 
          can "Yank" sectors from disk into memory one after  the 
          other until you have got all you can salvage, then copy 
          it down to 100 hex and save it to a new disk.

SUB       This  is  a bug free version of SUBMIT.

UNERASE   This allows you to unerase an erased file if it has not 
          been copied over.

UNLOAD    This  will convert a .COM file into an Intel HEX format 
          file.   It can then be copied to another computer using 
          PIP where it can be converted back again with LOAD.
          The format is:- UNLOAD d:filename 100

VERIFY    This verifies a disk.

VFILES    This verifies each of the files on a disk.

WORDS     This will count the number of words in a text file.  It 
          will  give  different number to SPELSTAR  as  spellstar 
          does not count single letter words.  The format is:-
               WORDS d:filename.ext

UNSPOOL   A  very useful program that will print a text file as a 
          background job while you run another program.   If your 
          printer  has a large buffer it does not  stop  printing 
          even  when your other program accesses the  disk.   The 
          format is:-  UNSPOOL d:filename.ext.

STATUS, DISKSTAT Difficult to describe, just execute them and you 
          will see what they give you.
