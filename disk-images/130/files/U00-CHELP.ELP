               If  the "C" command is entered in answer to  the 
          system prompt "*", the computer will list the current 
          assignment of the system. 
               The  current assignment of a system is a list of 
          FORMATS allocated to FLOPPYS and addressed as DRIVES.  
          For example, a Superbrain (FORMAT) could be allocated 
          to  FLOPPY  3  and addressed as  DRIVE  H:.  In  this 
          example  the operator would simply put  a  Superbrain 
          disk into FLOPPY 3 and refer to it as DRIVE H:.
